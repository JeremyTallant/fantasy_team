# Scout your Athletics Fantasy Team
## Description
If you were scouting out an athletics team, you would need to know more than just how far each person has jumped or thrown once. You want to know who is the most consistent, who fouls the least and who comes through in the clutch. And you will need to decide which aspects are most important to you so you can find the right balance.

In this R project, we will use dataframes and the `dplyr` package to find out who you should put on our team, and in doing so become the next "Moneyball" star manager of an athletics team.

We will use performance data collated from jumps and throws events in the US from 2013-2017.
## Usage
Clone this repository and open the Jupyter notebook file (`*.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment with R kernel support. Make sure to install the required packages such as `tidyverse`. You can do this by running the following commands in a code cell within the notebook:
``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
Once the packages are installed, run the code cells in the notebook to generate the plots and analyses.

If you don't have a Jupyter environment set up, you can install Jupyter Notebook and the R kernel using the following steps:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on the [official Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

2. Install the R kernel for Jupyter Notebook by running the following commands in your R console:
``` r 
install.packages("IRkernel")
IRkernel::installspec()
```
After completing the installation, launch Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the folder containing the notebook file, and open it to begin running the analysis.
